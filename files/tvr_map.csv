bytebit,description,notes
Byte1 bit8,Offline data authentication was not performed,"In the transaction, Offline Data Authentication (DDA or CDA) was not performed. This is usually as a result of either the terminal or card (or both) not supporting Offline Data Authentication."
Byte1 bit7,Offline static data authentication failed,"This means that during the transaction, the card was verified through the use of SDA (Static Data Authentication) and this validation failed. Therefore the card was not verified to be authentic. This condition could arise as a result of a fraud attempt, which must be investigated, or as a result of corrupted keys on the terminal. If the terminal shows a pattern of regular Offline Data Authentication failure outcomes, then it is most probably the terminal's key set that is an issue. PLEASE NOTE that SDA should not be used for Offline Data Authentication as SDA usage was discontinued by the Schemes."
Byte1 bit6,ICC data missing,"This is a technical alert, indicating that some of the required data that the terminal requested from the card was not provided. It is not usually serious, however the IAC and TAc settings must be looked at to see if this condition has been set up to result in a declined transaction."
Byte1 bit5,Card appears on terminal exception file,This means that the card is present on the hotcard list of the terminal. This card has been reported stolen and has been flagged with the various banks for a period of time.
Byte1 bit4,Offline dynamic data authentication failed,"This means that for this transaction an Offline Data Authentication method of DDA (Dynamic Data Authentication) was attempted but failed. Therefore the card was not verified to be authentic. This condition could arise as a result of a fraud attempt, which must be investigated, or as a result of corrupted keys on the terminal. If the terminal shows a pattern of regular Offline Data Authentication failure outcomes, then it is most probably the terminal's key set that is an issue."
Byte1 bit3,CDA failed,"This means that for this transaction an Offline Data Authentication method of CDA  (Combined Data Authentication) was attempted but failed. Therefore the card was not verified to be authentic. This condition could arise as a result of a fraud attempt, which must be investigated, or as a result of corrupted keys on the terminal. If the terminal shows a pattern of regular Offline Data Authentication failure outcomes, then it is most probably the terminal's key set that is an issue."
Byte1 bit2,SDA Selected,"For this transaction, Static Data Authentication was selected as the Offline Data Authentication type. This should not happen as SDA usage was discontinued by the Schemes."
Byte1 bit1,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte2 bit8,ICC and terminal have different application versions,This is a legacy indicator and should not affect the transaction outcome. The Schemes recommend that this bit is set to OFF (0-0-0) in the Terminal Action Codes and Issuer Action Codes.
Byte2 bit7,Expired application,This means that the transaction is later than the expiry date of the application/card. To understand the expected decision for this condition (decline or go online) please refer to the Issuer Action codes and Terminal Action Codes.
Byte2 bit6,Application not yet effective,This means that the transaction date is before the effective date of the application/card. To understand the expected decision for this condition (decline or go online) please refer to the Issuer Action codes and Terminal Action Codes.
Byte2 bit5,Requested service not allowed for card product,This means that the transaction is in breach of a product rule defined for this card in the card's Application Usage  Control tag (9F07).
Byte2 bit4,New card,"This means that this card is being used for the first time since it was issued to the customer. The Application Transaction Counter (ATC) prior to this transaction would have been 0, and this would have updated to a value of 1 after this transaction."
Byte2 bit3,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte2 bit2,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte2 bit1,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte3 bit8,Cardholder verification was not successful,"During the transaction, there was an attempt to verify the cardholder and this was unsuccesful. To understand what method was used to verify the customer, please refer to the transaction message (ISO8583) and obtain it from tag  9F34 in the Field 55 data. "
Byte3 bit7,Unrecognised CVM,"This means that the cardholder was verified through a means that the terminal does not recognise. An example of this is where a customer verifies themselves on a payment app on their mobile phone through the use of biometric or facial recognition methods. In this instance, the payment device will simply pass an indicator to the terminal confirming that cardholder verification was successful."
Byte3 bit6,PIN Try Limit exceeded,"This refers to the Offline PIN only, which is stored on the card itself. In this case, the customer has incorrectly entered their PIN for the maximum number of allowed tries and so Offline PIN may not be used to verify the customer in this transaction."
Byte3 bit5,PIN entry required and PIN pad not present or not working,"In this transaction, a PIN is required to verify the cardholder, but the pinpad on the terminal was not working. The rules for what should happen in this instance will be defined in the Terminal Action Codes and Issuer Action Codes."
Byte3 bit4,"PIN entry required, PIN pad present, but PIN was not entered","In this transaction, a PIN is required to verify the cardholder and the pinpad on the terminal was working correctly. However, for some reason, the customer did not enter a PIN. The rules for what should happen in this instance will be defined in the Terminal Action Codes and Issuer Action Codes."
Byte3 bit3,Online PIN entered,"In this transaction, the PIN input by the customer was encrypted into a PIN Block and sent online in fields 52 of the ISO8583 message for the online host system to verify. The card does not verify this PIN."
Byte3 bit2,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte3 bit1,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte4 bit8,Transaction exceeds floor limit,"The value of this transaction is higher than the floor limit that has been set up on the terminal. Usually this results in the transaction being forced online, with a decline if the terminal cannot complete an online connection. However, please refer to the Terminal Action Codes and Issuer Action Codes for this card/terminal to understand the rules for this product."
Byte4 bit7,Lower consecutive offline limit exceeded,"In this case, the value of the transaction is higher than the card's velocity check LOWER limit. Please refer to the limit set up on the card, as well as the pruct rule definition in the Terminal Action Codes and Issuer Action Codes."
Byte4 bit6,Upper consecutive offline limit exceeded,"In this case, the value of the transaction is higher than the card's velocity check UPPER limit. Please refer to the limit set up on the card, as well as the pruct rule definition in the Terminal Action Codes and Issuer Action Codes."
Byte4 bit5,Transaction selected randomly for online processing,This transaction was randomly selected to go online by the terminal. It does not mean that any card or terminal limits were breached for this to happen. 
Byte4 bit4,Merchant forced transaction online,"During the transaction, the merchant felt unsure about the validity of the cardholder, and forced the transaction online just in case the card was reported stolen. "
Byte4 bit3,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte4 bit2,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte4 bit1,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte5 bit8,Default TDOL used,"This is a technical alert, just indicating that during the transaction, the terminal did not receive an expected data object list from the card, and so it used a default data object list that is stored on the terminal. This data object list is a list of objects to be used to generate the TC hash value."
Byte5 bit7,Issuer authentication was unsuccessful,"This means that the transaction was sent online for authorisation, but when the transaction returned to the terminal, the card tried to verify that the authorisation response originated from the genuine host system, and this attempt failed. This will always result in a decline of the transaction. In the case of fraud, this will indicate that the response message was intercepted and changes made to the authorisation decison. However, this may also occur if the Issuer Authentication Data in the response message (tag 91) was somehow corrupted during transit somewhere between the time it left the issuer host system up until the terminal passed this value to the card."
Byte5 bit6,Script processing failed before final GENERATE AC,"During online transactions, the issuer may sometimes send Issuer scripts back to the card in the response message. These scripts are applied by the card and will make changes to certain tags or counters on the card. This result refers to those scripts that were attempted BEFORE the 2nd Gen AC phase of the transaction commences, but which could not be processed."
Byte5 bit5,Script processing failed after final GENERATE AC,"During online transactions, the issuer may sometimes send Issuer scripts back to the card in the response message. These scripts are applied by the card and will make changes to certain tags or counters on the card. This result refers to those scripts that were attempted AFTER the 2nd Gen AC phase of the transaction commences, but which could not be processed."
Byte5 bit4,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte5 bit3,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte5 bit2,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
