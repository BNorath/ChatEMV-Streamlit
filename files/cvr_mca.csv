Byte1 bit8+7=00,00,AAC returned in 2nd Gen AC,This was an ONLINE Transaction. The card issued a final decision to Decline the transaction after the host system responded to the message.
Byte1 bit8+7=01,01,TC returned in 2nd Gen AC,This was an ONLINE Transaction. The card issued a final decision to Approve the transaction after the host system responded to the message.
Byte1 bit8+7=10,10,AC not requested in 2nd Gen AC,"This was an ONLINETransaction. The Terminal did not request an authorisation decision from the Card, and the transaction may not have completed normally."
Byte1 bit8+7=11,11,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte1 bit6+5=00,00,AAC returned in 1st Gen AC,This was an OFFLINE Transaction. The card issued a final decision to Decline the transaction without requesting a decision from the host system. This decision was taken as a result of risk management processing by the Card and Terminal.
Byte1 bit6+5=01,01,TC returned in 1st Gen AC,This was an OFFLINE Transaction. The card issued a final decision to Approve the transaction without requesting a decision from the host system. This decision was taken as a result of risk management processing by the Card and Terminal.
Byte1 bit6+5=10,10,ARQC returned in 1st Gen AC,The card issued an initial decision to request an authorisation decision from the host system. This means that an ONLINE transaction should have been attempted. This decision was taken as a result of risk management processing by the Card and Terminal.
Byte1 bit6+5=11,11,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte1 bit4,1,Date Check Failed,"During the transaction the Card compared the transaction date with the Last Online Transaction Date stored on the card. If the value of this difference is greater than the Maximum No Of Days Offline Limit, then this bit is set to True in CVR. The associated behaviour will be defined in the Card Issuer Action Codes of the card, but usually this requires that the transaction be sent online."
Byte1 bit3,1,Offline PIN verification performed,"This means that a Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) of Plaintext Offline PIN was selected during the transaction. This PIN is passed in the clear from the terminal to the card, and is verified by the card. The PIN is NOT sent online for verification."
Byte1 bit2,1,Offline encrypted PIN verification performed,"This means that a Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) of Plaintext Offline PIN was selected during the transaction. This PIN is passed in the clear from the terminal to the card, and is verified by the card. The PIN is NOT sent online for verification."
Byte1 bit1,1,Offline PIN verification successful,This indicates that the card successfully verified that the PIN entered by the cardholder was correct. This could be either Offline Plaintext or Offline Encrypted PIN.
Byte2 bit8,1,DDA returned,"During the transaction, the card was authenticated using the Offline Data Authentication method of DDA (Dynamic Data Authentication)"
Byte2 bit7,1,CDA returned in 1st Gen AC,"During the transaction, the card was authenticated using the Offline Data Authentication method of CDA (Combined Data Authentication). This method uses DDA and adds the Application Cryptogram used for transaction authorisation as part of the check. In this case, CDA was done before the terminal sent the message ONLINE or during an OFFLINE transaction. From a terminal perspective, this means that the terminal supports CDA processing in Mode 1 OR in Mode 2."
Byte2 bit6,1,CDA returned in 2nd Gen AC,"During the transaction, the card was authenticated using the Offline Data Authentication method of CDA (Combined Data Authentication). This method uses DDA and adds the Application Cryptogram used for transaction authorisation as part of the check. In this case, CDA was done after the terminal sent the message ONLINE and received a respnse back from the Issuer Host system. From a terminal perspective, this means that the terminal supports CDA processing in Mode 1 OR in Mode 4."
Byte2 bit5,1,Issuer Authentication performed,"This means that the transaction was an ONLINE transaction, and that the card received Issuer Authentication Data back from the Host system to allow it to verify if the host system that responded is genuine. This bit, on its own, does not indicate if Issuer Authentication was successful or not, just that it was performed."
Byte2 bit4,1,Card Risk Management skipped on CAT3,"If this bit was set to true, it means that the terminal being used is a CAT3 terminal (Terminal Type 26)  and that the card has been set in the Application Control to skip checking the Default CIAC. This then allows the transaction to approve offline if no Decline conditions are encountered.  "
Byte2 bit3,1,Offline Change PIN Result,This refers to the ability to change the PIN on the card without receiving a PIN change script from the Issuer Host system. This feature is enabled on the card in the Application Control and may be done after first verifying the cardholder through his existing PIN. This is not recommended for us in cards that support both ONLINE and OFFLINE PINs as this will result in the OFFLINE and ONLINE PINS being out of sync. We should always perform the ONLINE PIN change first and then script to the card in an ONLINE transaction to sync the OFFLINE PIN. This bit should only be relevant for cards that only support OFFLINE PIN.
Byte2 bit2,1,Issuer Discretionary,This may be used by the Issuer to identify the MChip Advance Application version.
Byte2 bit1,1,Issuer Discretionary,"If this is set to True, then it could indicate that the Contactless Interface is being used for the transaction, i.e. this is a Tap and Go transaction. If this was set to 0 (False) it would have indicated that this is a Contact transaction."
Byte3 bit8to5,hex85,Right nibble script counter,is the value of the script counter at the time of this transaction. Please note that the maximum value it can reach is 15 (Hex = F) and thereafter it will cycle back to 0 and increment again. This indicates how many times scripts were sent to the card over its lifetime.
Byte3 bit4to1,hex41,Right nibble of PIN Try Counter,"is the value of the PIN try counter at the time of this transaction. This indicates how many PIN attempts are left after attempts made by the cardholder. Once this value =0, the OFFLINE PIN will be deemed to be blocked and will require a reset. When the PIN is reset, it will be set to the value of the PIN Try Limit, and will decrement for each subsequent incorrect OFFLINE PIN entry."
Byte4 bit8,1,Last online transaction not completed,"This indicates that during the PREVIOUS transaction of the card, the transaction went ONLINE but for some reason it did not complete correctly. This is flagged on the card and during this transaction was validated as part of the Card's Risk Management (checking the Card's CIAC) as to whether to decline this transaction or send in ONLINE. "
Byte4 bit7,1,Unable to go online,"This means that the terminal has indicated to the Card that it is unable to complete an ONLINE connection to send the transaction ONLINE for authorisation. This will result in an OFFLINE transaction, either Approved or Declined. The terminal will send an Authorisation Response Code to the card as follows: Y3 = Unable to go online, offline approved, OR Z3 = Unable to go online, offline declined."
Byte4 bit6,1,Offline PIN verification NOT performed,"This means that during the transaction, the Card did NOT perform CVM by checking a PIN captured by the cardholder. This could indicate that CVM was done through an ONLINE PIN (verified by Issuer Host), Signature (verified by a person) or something else (NoCvm)."
Byte4 bit5,1,Offline PIN verification failed,"This indicates that the Card verified a PIN entered by the cardholder and this check failed, i.e. the PIN entered by the Cardholder was incorrect."
Byte4 bit4,1,PIN Try Limit exceeded,This is when the value of the PIN Try Counter exceeds the value of the PIN Try Limit stored on the card. This means that the cardholder used up all of his attempts to capture a correct OFFLINE PIN that is verified by the Card.
Byte4 bit3,1,International Transaction,"This indicates that the transaction is being done in a country that is different from the country of issue of the card. In the MChip Advance specification this is determined by comparing the CRM Country Code value stored on the card against the Terminal Country Code stored on the terminal. If the two don't match, then it is deemed to be an International transaction and this bit is set to True."
Byte4 bit2,1,Domestic Transaction,"This indicates that the transaction is being done in the same country of issue of the card. In the MChip Advance specification this is determined by comparing the CRM Country Code value stored on the card against the Terminal Country Code stored on the terminal. If the two match, then it is deemed to be a Domestic transaction and this bit is set to True."
Byte4 bit1,1,Terminal erroneously considers offline PIN OK,"This is set when the Card has NOT successfully validated the OFFLINE PIN, but the Terminal considers the PIN verification to be successful. The Card is aware of the Terminal's mistake by verifying the CVM Results tag populated by the Terminal. If this Result show successful but the Card itself is aware that it has flagged OFFLINE PIN verification as unsuccessful, then it will set this bit in CVR to True."
Byte5 bit8,1,Lower consecutive counter 1 limit exceeded,"This indicates that the Lower velocity limit (counting the number of transactions) has been breached during this transaction. The relevant behaviour will be determined in the CIAC. Limits on MCA cards are split between Contact Limits and Contactless Limits. Usually Counter 1 limits are used for Contact transactions, and Counter 2 limits are used for Contactless transaction. Please confirm what pattern has been used for this card. "
Byte5 bit7,1,Upper consecutive counter 1 limit exceeded,"This indicates that the Upper velocity limit (counting the number of transactions) has been breached during this transaction. The relevant behaviour will be determined in the CIAC. Limits on MCA cards are split between Contact Limits and Contactless Limits. Usually Counter 1 limits are used for Contact transactions, and Counter 2 limits are used for Contactless transaction. Please confirm what pattern has been used for this card. "
Byte5 bit6,1,Lower cumulative counter 1 limit exceeded,"This indicates that the Lower cumulative limit (adding the values of consecutive OFFLINE transactions) has been breached during this transaction. The relevant behaviour will be determined in the CIAC. Limits on MCA cards are split between Contact Limits and Contactless Limits. Usually Counter 1 limits are used for Contact transactions, and Counter 2 limits are used for Contactless transaction. Please confirm what pattern has been used for this card. "
Byte5 bit5,1,Upper cumulative counter 1 limit exceeded,"This indicates that the Upper cumulative limit (adding the values of consecutive OFFLINE transactions) has been breached during this transaction. The relevant behaviour will be determined in the CIAC. Limits on MCA cards are split between Contact Limits and Contactless Limits. Usually Counter 1 limits are used for Contact transactions, and Counter 2 limits are used for Contactless transaction. Please confirm what pattern has been used for this card. "
Byte5 bit4,1,Go online on next transaction was set,"During the Card's PREVIOUS transaction, something occurred that set an internal bit on the Card's Previous Transaction History to send the next transaction online. During this transaction, this bit was copied into the CVR and will trigger the necessary behaviour once compared to the Card's CIAC."
Byte5 bit3,1,Issuer Authentication failed,"This means that the transaction was an ONLINE transaction, and that the card received Issuer Authentication Data back from the Host system to allow it to verify if the host system that responded is genuine. This bit indicates that this verification of the Issuer Host system has failed, which usually results in the card ignoring the Authorisation Response Cryptogram received from the host and declining the transaction. "
Byte5 bit2,1,Script received,"This means that the transaction went Online, and the Issuer sent back Issuer Scripts when it responded to the authorisation request, and these scripts were received by the Card."
Byte5 bit1,1,Script failed,This indicates that there was an issue when the Card attempted to apply the Issuer scripts it received in the transaction. The process failed and the changes that the scripts were supposed to achieve were not applied.
Byte6 bit8,1,Lower consecutive counter 2 limit exceeded,"This indicates that the Lower velocity limit (counting the number of transactions) has been breached during this transaction. The relevant behaviour will be determined in the CIAC. Limits on MCA cards are split between Contact Limits and Contactless Limits. Usually Counter 1 limits are used for Contact transactions, and Counter 2 limits are used for Contactless transaction. Please confirm what pattern has been used for this card. "
Byte6 bit7,1,Upper consecutive counter 2 limit exceeded,"This indicates that the Upper velocity limit (counting the number of transactions) has been breached during this transaction. The relevant behaviour will be determined in the CIAC. Limits on MCA cards are split between Contact Limits and Contactless Limits. Usually Counter 1 limits are used for Contact transactions, and Counter 2 limits are used for Contactless transaction. Please confirm what pattern has been used for this card. "
Byte6 bit6,1,Lower cumulative counter 2 limit exceeded,"This indicates that the Lower cumulative limit (adding the values of consecutive OFFLINE transactions) has been breached during this transaction. The relevant behaviour will be determined in the CIAC. Limits on MCA cards are split between Contact Limits and Contactless Limits. Usually Counter 1 limits are used for Contact transactions, and Counter 2 limits are used for Contactless transaction. Please confirm what pattern has been used for this card. "
Byte6 bit5,1,Upper cumulative counter 2 limit exceeded,"This indicates that the Upper cumulative limit (adding the values of consecutive OFFLINE transactions) has been breached during this transaction. The relevant behaviour will be determined in the CIAC. Limits on MCA cards are split between Contact Limits and Contactless Limits. Usually Counter 1 limits are used for Contact transactions, and Counter 2 limits are used for Contactless transaction. Please confirm what pattern has been used for this card. "
Byte6 bit4,1,MTA limit exceeded,This means that the Maximum Transaction Amount limit set on the card has been exceeded during the transaction. This MTA limit is set on the Card during issuance.
Byte6 bit3,1,No of Days Offline Limit Exceeded,This is a check indicating that the Card has been offline for a period of time that exceeds the Maximum No of Days Offline allowed by the No of Days OFFLINE LImit. This is done by comparing the transaction date of this transaction against the Last Online Transaction Date stored on the card and comparing the difference to the No of Days OFFLINE Limit.
Byte6 bit2,1,Match found in additional check table,This means that the card was configured to do additional checks over and above the standard Risk Management processing and that one of the criteria being used was present in the transaction.
Byte6 bit1,1,No match found in additional check table,"This means that the card was not configured to do additional checks over and above the standard Risk Management processing, OR it was but none of the criteria being used was present in the transaction."
