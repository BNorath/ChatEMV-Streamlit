bytebit,description,notes
Byte1 bit8,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte1 bit7,SDA supported,This means that the card supports an Offline Data Authentication method of Static Data Authentication. This should not be present anymore as the Schemes have required all Issuers to use the more secure methods of DDA or CDA.
Byte1 bit6,DDA supported,This means that the card supports an Offline Data Authentication method of Dynamic Data Authentication. DDA is used to authenticate that the card is genuine and not a counterfeit.
Byte1 bit5,Cardholder Verification supported,"The card supports the verification of the cardholder during an EMV transaction. This bit does not specify what kinds of cardholder verification are supported, but you may find these by looking at the CVM list [8E] set on the card."
Byte1 bit4,Terminal Risk management to be performed,This means that the card supports the risk management being done by the terminal outside of the card's own risk management and is capable of receiving an inoout from the terminal indicating the outcome of the terminal's risk management process.
Byte1 bit3,Issuer Authentication supported,"This means that the card supports Issuer authentication or OMA (Online Mutual Authentication) specifically through a process called EXTERNAL AUTHENTICATE. Had this bit been set to 0, it would have indicated that Issuer authentication would be done as part of the 2nd Gen AC process. The implication of this bit is not readily apparent and may only be distinguished if one were to look at the transaction logs of the dialogue between the terminal and card, using specialised tools. It is a technical bitset. "
Byte1 bit2,On device CVM supported (Contactless only),RFU for contact
Byte1 bit1,CDA supported,This means that the card supports an Offline Data Authentication method of CDA. It is used to authenticate that the card is genuine and not a counterfeit. CDA is a combination of DDA with the cryptogram generated during the 1st Gen and/or 2nd Gen AC processes.
Byte2 bit8,EMV Mode supported (Contactless only),"This bit should only be on for a contactless card. For a card that does not support contactless, i.e. contact-only, this bit should be set to RFU (reserved for future use. 
This indicates that the card is capable of contactless transactions in EMV mode. This means that during the transaction, the card will support Offline Data Authentication like CDA, Terminal Risk Management, Terminal Action Analysis and Application Cryptogram processing. The alternative is magstripe mode where these validations are not performed. In magstripe mode the card uses Compute Cryptographic Checksum (CCC) instead, which will cause the card to generate Dynamic CVC3 (Card Verification Code) values that can be inserted into the track 1 and track 2 equivalent data that was supplied by the card."
Byte2 bit7,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte2 bit6,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte2 bit5,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte2 bit4,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte2 bit3,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte2 bit2,RFU,This means that this bit is Reserved for Future Use. It has no valid meaning at this point in time and may be ignored.
Byte2 bit1,Relay Resistance protocol supported (Contactless only),"This bit should only be on for a contactless card. For a card that does not support contactless, i.e. contact-only, this bit should be set to RFU (reserved for future use. 
This bit indicates that the card supports the Relay Resistance protocol. This indicates that the card is capable of detecting and preventing relay attacks, which makes it more secure. Relay attacks are a type of attack where a fraudster uses a device to intercept and relay communication between a payment terminal and a payment card. By relaying the communication, the fraudster can trick the terminal into accepting a fraudulent transaction."
