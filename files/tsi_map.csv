Byte1 bit8,Offline data authentication was performed,"In the transaction, Offline Data Authentication (DDA or CDA) was performed. This is the terminal's offline verification of the card to ensure that the card is genuine."
Byte1 bit7,Cardholder verification was performed,"This means that during the transaction, an attempt was made to verify that the cardholder is the authorised person to use the card. This could take the form of offline PIN verified by the card, online PIN verified by the host, signature, biometric, etc depending on what CVM types are mutually supported by the card and terminal. This bit does not indicate what type of CVM was used."
Byte1 bit6,Card risk management was performed,"During the transaction, there was phase where the card procesed risk management by using card-specific (non-shared) EMV tags. This process would contribute to the final decison for the transaction to decline, approve or go online. The card risk management detail is not shared with the terminal, but the outcome of this process is available in the transaction data through CVR."
Byte1 bit5,Issuer Authentication was performed,"This means that the transaction was sent online to the Issuer host, where the host verified that the card was genuine by performing cryptographic checks of the ARQC that was created by the card. Thereafter, the host responded with an ARPC which the card validated to ensure that the online system responding to the transaction was a genuine system. This bit merely indicates that this process took place, not if it was successful or not."
Byte1 bit4,Terminal risk management was performed,"During the transaction, the terminal procesed risk management by applying various checks using EMV tags on both the terminal and card. This process would contribute to the final decison for the transaction to decline, approve or go online. The detail of this process may be viewed in the transaction's TVR."
Byte1 bit3,Script processing was performed,"This indicates thatthe transaction was sent online to the Issuer host to be included in the final authorisation decision, and when the host responded with a transaction response, it also included 1 or multiple Issuer scripts in field 55 of the response message. The terminal passed these scripts on to the card and the card applied the scripts to make changes to the EMV data on the application. "
